# Dockerfile for the Redpanda Broker
# We use the official image provided by Redpanda Data.
FROM docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda:latest

# The Redpanda image is ready to run and already exposes the necessary ports:
# 29092 (Kafka internal)
# 8081 (Schema Registry)
# 9644 (Admin API)

# The deployment YAML already specifies the 'command' to start the broker.
# No further customization is required for this standard deployment.
